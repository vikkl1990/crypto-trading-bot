UserRealManager — Per-user real trading execution for VN Edge.

Each user gets their own manager instance with:
- Their own Delta exchange API keys (decrypted from DB)
- Their own risk limits (leverage, daily loss, position size)
- Their own circuit breaker (independent from other users)
- Their own trade monitoring loops

Paper trading is SHARED (global signal engine). Real trading is PER-USER.

# When PHASE2_SOS_ENABLED env var is true AND user is in shadow_live mode,
# every paper signal spawns N virtual trades — one per config — each with
# its own _monitor_trade task. PnL per config emerges from REAL price
# evolution (no approximation). After 24-48h, leaderboard via
# scripts/phase2_leaderboard.py reveals which exit profile preserves
# the most paper edge.
# See: docs/PHASE2_SHADOW_OF_SHADOW_DESIGN.md
# Each config dict:
#   id            — unique identifier (string)
#   max_age_sec   — hard time-decay close threshold
#   trail_trigger — peak_mfe_r required to engage BE+lock
#   trail_lock    — fraction of peak to lock as new SL
#   dead_kill_R   — UNIFIED_KILL_CURRENT_R override (None = disabled)
#   stall_kill_R  — STALL_CURRENT_R override (None = disabled)
#   tp_R          — exit at +N×R if peak reaches it (None = no TP)

        Observed today: two orphan BTC long positions on admin+niranjan
        that were never persisted to DB. Happens when the bot restarts
        AFTER the Delta order filled but BEFORE the DB insert completed.
        DB says flat, exchange has live position, nobody is monitoring.

        Fix: for each preferred_symbol, query Delta directly. If exchange
        shows a non-zero position that we don't have in self.open_trades,
        synthesize a minimal UserTradeRecord and spawn a monitor task.
        SL defaults to 0.65% away from entry in the unfavourable direction
        (matches typical scalp SL). The position is marked with a synthetic
        trade_id and logged LOUDLY so it shows up in audit.

        # Kelly allocation of ~1-2% bankroll risk per trade. At 20× leverage
        # and 0.65% SL, that maps to ~22% of balance as margin. Previous
        # 15% cap was under-sized by ~40% vs Kelly. Three-consecutive-loss
