"""Phase 5.8 — Unified exit-guard helpers.

This module is the single source of truth for the dead-signal kill cascade
that was previously stacked across `user_real_manager.py`,
`bot/signal_tracker.py`, and `bot/trade_simulator.py`.

Background
----------
Pre-5.8 the bot ran four overlapping fast-kill guards:

    quick_kill         age >  30s,  peak <= 0.02R, current < -0.05R
    no_proof_of_life   age >  90/180s, peak < 0.05R, current < 0    (A+/A only)
    early_kill         age >  60-90s,  peak < kill_mfe, current < 0 (B/C only)
    zombie_kill        age > 600s, peak < 0.10R, current < 0

Together they cut trades faster than the round-trip taker fee floor could be
recovered (`fees ~= 10bp r/t == ~0.15R on a 0.65% SL`). 24h shadow_live data
2026-04-24 → 2026-04-25: 12% WR, -$12.27 net, 64% of losses were pure fees.

5.8 collapses the four guards into one fee-floor-aware check. See
`docs/EXIT_GUARD_REFACTOR_5_8.md` for the full design + rollout plan.

Pure functions
--------------
Everything here takes primitive arguments (entry, sl, age_sec, regime, ...)
rather than a Trade or self reference. That keeps the module trivially
unit-testable and importable from all three engines (real, paper, backtest)
without any one of them having to import the others.
